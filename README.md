This project has the purpose of developing myself as a back-end engineer.

It's a study project of registering coffee capsules. Such as:

- User creation - JWT authentication, being able to create and reset passwords.
- Coffee registration, saving information such as brand, coffee type, and the price in the purchase date.
- Holds inventory to register how many capsules have been consumed in the week.
- And when the users want to be notified when it is at the end of the box.

### Currently, the application has:

- User authentication
- User list

### Next features üèóÔ∏è:

- Coffee registration
- Inventory
- Notification
- Swagger - for documentation.
